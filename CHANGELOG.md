### Added
- **Hybrid Architecture — Chaining Classical ML → Neural Network**
  - This release upgrades the app from a 2-model classical ML system into a true **hybrid system** that **chains** classical ML output into a neural network (LLM) for natural-language reasoning.
  - **The chain:** Decision Tree (Stage 1) → Polynomial Ridge (Stage 2) → Gemma Neural Network (Stage 3)
  - Added Google Gemini SDK integration via `google-generativeai==0.8.3`
  - **Stage 3 model:** `gemma-3n-e4b-it` — Google's transformer-based neural network LLM (proven from RJ_BLP_1)
  - On-demand AI-generated 4-5 sentence sarcastic narrative explanations
  - Click the floating ✨ sparkle icon (top-right of prediction card) to invoke Stage 3

- **`ai_narrator.py` module — the chaining handoff**
  - Implements proven ROLE / CONTEXT / TASK / INPUT prompt pattern
  - **Chains** Stage 1 + Stage 2 outputs into a structured prompt for Stage 3
  - Builds prompts using classical ML prediction + raw user input data
  - Robust JSON parsing (strips markdown fences)
  - Graceful degradation if API key missing

- **`/ai_narrate` POST endpoint**
  - Accepts JSON payload with prediction + form data
  - Returns `{success, narrative}` or `{success, message}` on failure
  - Never returns 500 — all errors handled gracefully

- **Sparkle icon UI**
  - Pulsing animation to invite curiosity
  - Hover effect (scale + rotate)
  - Loading spin animation while fetching
  - Hides after successful response (one-shot per prediction)

- **AI Narrator response card**

- `static/css/style.css` — added ~120 lines for sparkle button & narrator card styling
- `DEPLOY.md` — added API key setup section (Step 7b)

### Educational Value
- Demonstrates **hybrid AI architecture**: classical ML (sklearn) **chained** with neural network (Gemma transformer LLM)
- Teaches the **chaining pattern**: classical model output → LLM prompt input
- Shows **prompt engineering** with structured ROLE / CONTEXT / TASK / INPUT
- Teaches **API integration** in Flask
- Models **graceful degradation** patterns
- Demonstrates **secrets management** via gitignored `config.py`

### Security
- API key stored in `config.py` (gitignored, never committed)
- Manual setup on PythonAnywhere via `nano config.py` (one time)
- Server logs warning if key missing but never crashes
- App works perfectly without AI key (sparkle icon just hidden)
